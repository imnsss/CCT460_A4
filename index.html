                    <h2> "Toronto Skyline"</h2>
                    <h3>Brief</h3>
                    <p>Replicate a photo by using p5js regular and irregular shapes. This work explores my ability and flexibility in applying p5js functions. I chose a photo I had captured on Toronto Central Island. This photo includes multiple shapes and is a good practice for understanding p5js.</p>

                    <h2>"Falling Stars"</h2>
                    <h3>Brief</h3>
                    <p>I integrated the idea of the Week 3 in-class practice and shooting star. It looks abstract, but I think it is quite artistic (maybe not). Through this assignment, I practiced the knowledge (variable, for loop, shape, rotate, map, random, OOP, and array) I learned in CCT460.</p>
                    <h3>Key Features</h3>
                    <ul>

                    <h2>"Doge!"</h2>
                    <h3>Brief</h3>
                    <p>When you come home, you find there is a cute dog in your bedroom! You don't know his name but you can play with him and feed him!</p>
                    <p>I bought this assets 3 years ago and used the assets because I found it is hard to draw cute Tamagotchi by p5js shapes (my skill is limited). Therefore, I used the cute doge assets and focus more on the function implement.
                        Now the doge has hunger and happiness bar. The doge will feel bad if he starves!! Left click to feed him and right click to give him a bone! Hold Space can make him move!!</p>
                    <h3>Key Features</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interactive Design (you can feed and play with the doge)</li>
                        <li>Stats Display (check Doge's status)</li>
                        <li>Dynamic reactions (Doge will be emotional when he feels hungry)</li>
